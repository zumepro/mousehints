# mousehints

Picture this: you are a long-time Gentoo/Arch/LFS user who has been exclusively using keyboard-driven tools like Vim, ranger, qutebrowser/Vimium, zathura, sxiv, etc. At this point, you could essentially live inside a TTY with tmux.

However, one day, you stumble across a GUI application (you know, those ones with flashy buttons, popups and whatnot) and need to navigate it.

**To your horror, it does not support keybindings. Like at all.**

In this highly unlikely scenario, one would simply reach for the humble computer mouse.

Not you, though. You are special. You - *are a Vim user*. The mouse is yucky and gross. It is **bloat**. It destroys your productivity by having to move your hands off of the keyboard over to some rodent device, and that simply is *unacceptable*.

If you are that type of computer user, fear no more! We bring you the finest solution: **mousehints**.

## What is it?

**mousehints** allows you to move the mouse cursor around the screen and make interactions with it **only using your keyboard**.

Cutting-edge features include:
- efficient design with more than 70 hotkeys
- being able to reach virtually any pixel on a Full HD screen with at most 6 keypresses
- scroll wheel simulation
- clicking (or holding) one or more mouse buttons (left, right, middle)
- drag and drop support (holding down a button while moving the cursor)
- helpful dynamic screen overlay
- lightweight
- **written in Rust ðŸ¦€**
- **you can finally throw your mouse into the garbage**

All jokes aside, this tool might actually be a useful tool for some folks, especially for those who suffer from [carpal tunnel syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome) or perhaps some disability which inhibits longer-distance hand movement in some way. With mousehints, those individuals would not have to move their hands as much, possibly reducing the pain associated with normally using the mouse.

Please note, however, that **mousehints has not (yet) been clinically tested**.
